# Intro

# LiPD Datasets

-   Streamlining paloedatasets
-   Linked Paleodata
-   A data container, with flexibility
-   Ensemble tables are key to this

## Including metadata

-   dataSetName
-   orginalDataUrl
-   investigators
-   LiPDVersion
-   Geographic
-   Publication
-   Funding

## Chrondata

Measurement tables

And models (e.g. age/depth models) - parameters (e.g. for bacon) - summary table - ensemble tables (very important for geochronR) - distribution table (mainly for radiocarbon)

## Paleodata

Connects to physical objects (generally)

Measurement tables - all the things you measured from the material - plus inferred variables - climate interpretation

## Creating a LiPD

There are tools to do this, you don't need to do it manually!

Using the LiPD Playground: <https://lipd.net/playground>

## Finding LiPD data

<https://lipdverse.org>

Contains common compilations of Holocene climate data e.g. temperature 12k

## Additional questions from audience

Neotoma database and format: <http://www.goring.org/resources/Neotoma_Lesson.html>

Neotoma+LiPD ara interoperable: working on over the next month

Pangea is not yet that compatible

# Roadmap

<http://linked.earth/geochronr-hackathon/schedule>

Can work at different times - groups are sorted by timezones

Three slides - 5 mins max

1.  What we learned/went well
2.  What was frustrating
3.  That you'd ike to see in geoChroR or future hackathons
